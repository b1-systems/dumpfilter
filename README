dumpfilter - Linux coredump filter

dumpfilter is a configureable helper script that allows you to control how
coredumps of crashed applications are created.

- Creates a core.info file, with collected informations about the dying process
  It also attaches custom commands run after the core dump into the info file.
  By default gdb is run to print the backtrace and registers.
- Compresses the core file with gzip, allowing the dump process to be faster
  If you write to a nfs mount, it will be much faster. Install pigz for max performance.
- Ensures free space (10% default) on the mountpoint it dumps
